## 📌 When to Use This Template

Use this template when you need to:
- Document undocumented ROS 2 navigation algorithms or sensor fusion code
- Extract requirements from legacy code before refactoring
- Create architecture documentation for existing systems
- Analyze complex navigation logic to understand behavior
- Prepare for major refactoring by understanding current implementation

**Common scenarios:**
- Understanding path planning algorithms in nav_control
- Documenting sensor fusion logic in localization components
- Analyzing obstacle avoidance behavior
- Creating API documentation from existing code
